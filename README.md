this is a food donation management system using front end
In highly populated countries like India, food wastage is a disturbing issue. The streets, garbage bins and landfills have ample proof to prove it. Marriages, canteens, restaurants, social and family get-togethers and functions expel out so much food. Food wastage is not only an indication of hunger or pollution, but also of many economic problems. The high standard of living has resulted in the wastage of food, clothes, etc. because of quick changes in habits and lifestyle. Instead of wasting these things we can put them in use by donating them to various organizations such as orphanages, old age homes, etc. This is a web based application that basically aims at charity through donations.
The proposed application shall reduce food wastage and also fulfill the requirements.
